### Reflections:
Honestly, I’m proud of myself. This thing was just an idea in my head yesterday, and today it's live.

I built a mobile-first landing page that works — clean design, Rocjet-style gradient, and Netlify-powered email capture. It shows a message when someone subscribes. Everything works beautifully.

What blows my mind is: I did this *all* on my phone — no laptop, no VS Code, no fancy setup. Just Termux, Nano, Git, Netlify... and focus.

This isn’t just about launching a webpage — it’s about proving to myself that I can build and ship with what I have.

> One page. One email box. One clean message. And that’s how it begins.
